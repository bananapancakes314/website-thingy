I've never posted a video of myself playing piano on the internet before this.  But, one of the perks of being home alone for most of spring break is that I can practice my favorite annoying songs without bothering my housemates.

So, here we go:

Since uploading the clip to youtube, I've developed the exciting new hobby of watching it at half speed so that I can tear myself apart over timing errors.  Yikes.  So, to combat my crippling insecurity, this next section will include a handful of disclaimers and excuses.

This piece is quite messy for a number of reasons: 
1. The keys on this keyboard are only 3/4 the width of actual piano keys, which isn't great for a song that relies on muscle memory
2. The keyboard is missing a few octaves, which also isn't great for muscle memory
3. There are no dynamics- every note on the keyboard is played at the same volume, so a crucial aspect of the song is missing
4. I haven't touched a metronome since winter break
5. And finally, I have a tendency to sacrifice accuracy for speed.  I have wayy more fun when I'm perpetually on the verge of spinning out of control.  This song provides me with the rare opportunity to test the limitations of my brain's processing speed- I wouldn't want to sacrifice it by slowing down and doing things the right way. 

Although I like recording my progress as I learn difficult songs, I absolutely hate the facial expressions I make while playing.  At any given time, I'm either biting on the inside of my lip until it bleeds, tilting my head 90 degrees to the right, or driving my chin as far into my neck as possible.  If I focus on it, I can usually manage to look normal while playing, but this song in particular takes up all of my mental energy.  I really hope that my face doesn't do these sorts of things while I'm concentrating on other tasks..

Anyways, this post is getting boring.  If you've made it this far, thanks for sticking around.  Hopefully I'll have more interesting content once break is over and I start interacting with actual (non-Lucas) humans again

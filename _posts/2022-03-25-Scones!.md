Minor life update: I made scones!  
<!-- more -->

The process of baking scones is utterly terrifying because up until the moment you pull them out of the oven, everything looks wrong.  The dough is a dry crumbly mess, and folding the blueberries in without crushing them is nearly impossible.  

I was particularly concerned because the heavy cream I bought at the store sort of turned into whipped cream in my bag during my walk home (oops).  Instead of pouring it into a measuring cup, I had to open up the container and scoop some of it out.  But thanks to a miracle that happened inside the oven, everything turned out alright
